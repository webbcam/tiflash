Session
=======

There are a variety of ways for specifying a device to connect to.
Below are a list of arguments you can provide for specifying how to connect to
a device.

.. note:: You should always specify all session arguments *before* specifying the
    command you wish to execute.

.. argparse::
    :module: tiflash.core.__main__
    :func: generate_parser
    :prog: tiflash
    :nosubcommands:

.. note:: Most often youâ€™ll only need to supply the serial number and TIFlash will
    try to automatically determine the default configurations (device type,
    connection, chip, etc.) to use when connecting to the device.
